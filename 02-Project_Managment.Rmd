# Project Managment {#managment}

### *Introduction*

While not directly related to data management, bad project management will cripple your ability to keep track of data, produce new data, and complete your interdisciplinary project in a timely manner.  

### *Summary*

If your data/output will be available for open source scrutiny, then the data must be legible to an outsider coming in without consulting you.  A data dictionary, detailed summary, data connection map, ect - are all tools that should be implemented.  This allows for future projects to use the data with minimal effort in understanding what they're working with.

### *Pitfalls*

If your spreadsheet contains columns/rows without identifiers, are connected in ways that aren't documented, or has so many files that it would be impossible for someone not on the project to understand - then it will be useless to any future researchers looking to use the data.  Your data should always carry supplemental information with explanation, particularly when that data is going to be in long term storage at a project's end.
