More than many other projects, good communication &amp; project planning from the very beginning is critical for an interdisciplinary &amp; highly collaborative project - as several teams will be bringing their own workflows &amp; communication channels to the table. 3.0.2 Questions to Consider What are the specific goals and outputs for the project? For your team? Do different teams have different goals in mind for this project? What communication channels will be used? Will data be shared through these channels? How will the team update each other on data changes? Who is responsible for the data? Will different teams be in charge of different data sets? Who is ultimately responsible for quality control of which outputs? 3.0.3 Pitfalls There are several potential pitfalls to poor project management. From a data prospective - poor project management can quickly lead to disorganized file storage, miss communication on project goals, scope creep, and unclear roles on who is responsible for the data. 3.0.4 Additional Resources While project management is important, it is not the focus of this tutorial - for more information on planning your IHCR project, please refer to this project charter.
